# Falling-blocks
A simple "endless falling objects" game, made as practice for my C# skills and as an introduction to Unity. Currently complete for desktop, planning to introduce mobile support.

Please feel free to clone the repo to your system in order to mess around with it in unity. If you just want to download and test/play the game then instead only download the "falling blocks" exe file, which is a Windows installer.

The last version of Unity this project was opened in was Unity 2018.1.6f1 (64 bit)

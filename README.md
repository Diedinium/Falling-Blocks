# Falling-blocks
A simple "endless falling objects" game, made as practice for my C# skills and as an introduction to Unity. Currently complete for desktop, planning to introduce mobile support.

At the bottom of the list is an installer for the game, simply install and run it to set the game up on your system, if you want to view the code then simply clone the repository to your system.
